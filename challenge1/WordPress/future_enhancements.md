# Future Enhancements to Productionize WordPress Deployment

## Overview
To improve our WordPress deployment for production, we plan to implement several enhancements that focus on security, scalability, and reliability.

### See Diagram.png

### Planned Enhancements
## Use Azure Front Door and Private Link:

Securely access the Container App through Azure Front Door, improving security and performance with WAF and CDN features.
### Separate Database Server and Redis:

Enhance performance and scalability by using Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Cache for Redis.
### Integrate VNet with Container App:

Improve security by isolating the Container Apps within a Virtual Network.
### Add TLS Certificates:

Encrypt all traffic, ensuring secure communication between clients and the server.
### Scaling and Monitoring:

Automatically adjust resources based on demand and improve observability with comprehensive monitoring and logging. 
Forward logs and traces to Datadog with a logging pipeline.
### Backup and Recovery (Azure Files and Maria DB):

Ensure data integrity and availability with automated backups.
### Use Azure Key Vault for Secrets:

Securely manage and access secrets, keys, and certificates, enhancing security and compliance.
### Managed Identity to Access Azure Container Registry (ACR):

Improve security by eliminating the need for hard-coded credentials and enabling secure access to ACR.

## Future Enhancements in the Pipeline
### Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline:
Set up a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, integration, and deployment processes. (see .github/workflows)

### Linting:
Integrate linters (e.g., ESLint, PHP_CodeSniffer) into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce coding standards and improve code quality.

### Unit Testing:
Incorporate unit testing frameworks (e.g., PHPUnit for PHP) into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code reliability and catch issues early in the development process.

### End-to-End Testing:
Utilize tools like Cypress or Selenium to perform end-to-end testing, ensuring that the application works as expected in real-world scenarios.

### Performance Testing:
Integrate performance testing tools (e.g., JMeter, Locust) to monitor and optimize the application's performance under various load conditions.

### Security Testing:
Add security testing tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Snyk) to the pipeline to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the codebase.

### Automated Deployment:
Automate deployment processes using tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins to ensure consistent and reliable deployments.
## Conclusion
These enhancements will make our WordPress deployment more secure, scalable, and reliable for production, leveraging Azure's capabilities to provide a robust platform.
